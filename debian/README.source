mojarra for Debian
==================

This release of mojarra contains only the sources for the API of Mojarra
JavaServer Faces 2.2.

It was obtained from

https://maven.java.net/content/repositories/releases/javax/faces/javax.faces-api/2.2/javax.faces-api-2.2-sources.jar

The jar file was then recompressed with xz.
